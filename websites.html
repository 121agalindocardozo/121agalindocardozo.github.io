          <button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='download.jpg'">close mouth</button>
              <center><a href="https://codehs.com/editor/html/1233482/820715/index.html"><img id="myImage" src="download.jpg" style=" align: left; width: 300px;"></a></center>
              <button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='open.png'">open mouth</button>
              <p>my first website: this website was made after learning the basics of html. this website displays some of the many things i like for example
                cartoon characters, songs, and books.</p>
          <p> it used to have more and the graph was completed until my code erased itself out of no where and i had to turn
        that in for a project grade the first marking period of my sophomore year</p>

          <h3>City Guide</h3>

          <p>this website was made to inform people about the beautiful city of New Orleans. our teacher wnated us to inform people
          about popular cities while also using a dropdown menu in a navigation bar that was also stuck at the top or "sticky."</p>
          <p>i am also proud of this website because it was my first time using a carousel which displayed a pictures in a mini slideshow. in this project i learned a lot about new orleans and its culture and history and also
        the best places to eat and stay while visiting.</p>

          <h3>Astrology</h3>
          <center><a href="https://codehs.com/editor/html/1370674/820715/index.html"><img src="system.png" style=" align: left; width: 300px;"></a></center>
          <p>this one is my favorite website that i have and i am really proud of. in this project we were told to add little animations in pictures or words.
          this project was about something that we enjoy or our "passion." one of the things that i really enjoy learning about is horoscopes and astrology. </p>
          <p>its really interesting to me
          that depending on what time and place you were born will affect you and your personality based on the position of the planets stars and sun. and i get more interested when things align
          with how people act and when their personalities are alike to their zodiac sign</p>
