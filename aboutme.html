  <center style="font-size: 20px; "><p>My name is Alexander Galindo and I am 16 years old as of July 27. I am currently in my second year of the web design program.
  During my two years being in this program I created a few websites based on what our teacher wanted it to be about. This website will be my portfolio where 
  you will see everything that I worked on and created. You will also be able to see my current interest on this page.</p></center>

		        <th style="font-size: 30px;  font-style:italic;"> Baby blue is my favorite color beacause of how
			    cold yet warm it looks. Its a really nice color to look at and a nice color that is associated with a lot

		The animation and the drawing of all the pokemons is so amazing looking to me and not to mention its pretty sad. You 
		didn't watch the movie if you didn't cry when Ash turned to stone. </td>

                <td style="font-size: 30px; font-style:italic;"> Cookie dough is the best ice cream ever. You can taste the flavor
		of the vanilla mixed with pieces of chocolate and cookie dough pieces. Not to mention the best cookie which is chocolate
		chip and the two combined together on the scrumptious waffle cone is amazing. </td>
